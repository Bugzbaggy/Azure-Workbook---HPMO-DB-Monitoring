# Azure-Workbook---HPMO-DB-Monitoring
Provide a summary view of all monitored SQL in Azure VM and SAP HABA DB. It displays a matrix of tiles, arranged into defined groups, with each one representing availability, health and performance statistics.

The single pane of glass watches the status and key metrics of estate in one place. Continuously monitors the availability, health and performance statistics of all of these SQL in Azure VM, collecting and assessing a range of machine- and SQL Server- metrics, and associated alert data and then presenting it in a single graphical web interface for review and analysis.

By collecting and analyzing metrics over time, SQL Performance Dashboard makes it easier to spot and fix concerns before they become a problem that impacts the running of the SQL Servers. It reveals disconcerting trends, such as rapid database growth, disk usage statistics, backup status, alerts and uses baselines to compare the current server behavior to historical behavior over similar periods, to help understand when performance patterns are abnormal, and why.
